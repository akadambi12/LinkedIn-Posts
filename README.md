[Leveraging SQL OpenQuery for Data Access in Restricted Environments](https://github.com/akadambi12/LinkedIn-Posts/blob/main/Green%20Teal%20Geometric%20Modern%20Computer%20Programmer%20Code%20Editor%20Quotes%20Instagram%20Post.pdf)

In the world of data analytics, accessing data from diverse sources efficiently is crucial. I want to share a case study where SQL OpenQuery played a pivotal role in overcoming access restrictions to achieve seamless data integration.

Situation:

Let's say that your team was tasked with consolidating sales data from multiple sources into a single reporting database. The sources included a Microsoft SQL Server and a PostgreSQL database. However, due to security policies, you were not granted direct access to the PostgreSQL database.

Challenge:

Directly querying the PostgreSQL database was not an option due to the access restrictions. you need a workaround that would allow you to integrate the data without violating security policies.

Solution: SQL OpenQuery

SQL OpenQuery provided the perfect workaround for this challenge. By using OpenQuery, you can run distributed queries on the remote PostgreSQL database from our SQL Server, effectively bypassing the need for direct access.
